# PrioMed

Have you ever waited so long in a hospital that the doctor seems to never get to you?

When waiting for medical assistance time runs so much slower.
Waiting on the corridor is unbearable especially when in pain. Most of the times
it's impossible for a doctor to pick which patient needs the most urgent medical attention
and just takes care of them in the order they came. When it comes to illness, time is incredibly precious and a lot of patients suffer because they did not get help in time.

Our project wants to help the patient as well as the doctor. The program is designed to put in order the patients depending on the gravity of their state and inform the doctor who should be next in line. To do so, the patient completes an online form, which is traditionally filled on paper, but now is being sent to a database. Using the application on his tablet, the doctor can access the data and customise his criteria of ordering depending on his speciality.

PrioMed aims to connect the patient and the doctor and to create a sense of trust and security between the two parts.
